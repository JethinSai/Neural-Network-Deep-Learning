In this assignment,
The first program takes an input string, removes at least 2 characters from it, 
and then reverses the remaining characters before displaying the result. 
The second program replaces occurrences of the word 'python' with 'pythons' in a user-provided sentence. 
Lastly, the third program calculates a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on a class score input using a 
predetermined grading scheme and prints the determined grade. 
These concise Python programs showcase string manipulation, text replacement, and conditional statements.

In this assignment,
The first code snippet provided creates a Python function fullname to concatenate a first name and last name into a full name, and another function string_alternative to return every other character from a given string. It then takes user input for first and last names, combines them, and applies string_alternative to the full name.
The second code snippet is designed to count the frequency of each word in a text file. It uses regular expressions to identify words and a dictionary to keep track of word counts. The script reads from a file, counts the words, and then prints the original text and word counts. Finally, it writes these results to an output file.
The third code snippet performs a similar function to the second, but focuses on output format. It reads lines from an input file, counts the occurrences of each word, and then writes only the word counts to an output file under the heading "Word_Count:". This script is streamlined for specific output formatting.
