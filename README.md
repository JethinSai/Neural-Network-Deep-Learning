In this assignment,
The first program takes an input string, removes at least 2 characters from it, 
and then reverses the remaining characters before displaying the result. 
The second program replaces occurrences of the word 'python' with 'pythons' in a user-provided sentence. 
Lastly, the third program calculates a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on a class score input using a 
predetermined grading scheme and prints the determined grade. 
These concise Python programs showcase string manipulation, text replacement, and conditional statements.

# Assinmet 2
In this assignment,
The first code snippet provided creates a Python function fullname to concatenate a first name and last name into a full name, and another function string_alternative to return every other character from a given string. It then takes user input for first and last names, combines them, and applies string_alternative to the full name.
The second code snippet is designed to count the frequency of each word in a text file. It uses regular expressions to identify words and a dictionary to keep track of word counts. The script reads from a file, counts the words, and then prints the original text and word counts. Finally, it writes these results to an output file.
The third code snippet performs a similar function to the second, but focuses on output format. It reads lines from an input file, counts the occurrences of each word, and then writes only the word counts to an output file under the heading "Word_Count:". This script is streamlined for specific output formatting.

# Assinmet 3
In this assignment,
The 1st Quation The code defines two classes, Employee and Fulltime Employee, where Fulltime Employee inherits from Employee. The Employee class tracks the number of employees and their total salary, offering a method to calculate the average salary. Instances of both Employee and Fulltime Employee are created, each with attributes like name, family, salary, and department. Finally, it prints the average salary of all employees and the total number of employees, demonstrating class inheritance, class methods, and class variables in action.
In The 2nd Quation The code Generate a 20-element array of random floating-point numbers between 1 and 20. Reshape this array into a 4x5 matrix. Identify and replace the maximum value in each row of the matrix with 0, using advanced indexing techniques. Print the final modified matrix, showcasing the altered values.

In this assignment,
The 1st Quation The code first imports Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for data manipulation and visualization. It reads data from a CSV file into a Data Frame df, and then performs basic statistical analysis to describe the data and check for null values. Null values are replaced with the mean of their respective columns. Next, it aggregates the 'Calories' and 'Pulse' columns to find their minimum, maximum, count, and mean. The data is further filtered to create subsets based on specific calorie conditions. A new Data Frame df_modified is created by dropping the 'Maxpulse' column. Finally, the 'Calories' column is converted to integer type, and a scatter plot is generated to visualize the relationship between 'Duration' and 'Calories'.
In the 2nd Quation 
First, it reads salary data and divides it into two parts: one for learning (training) and one for testing. It then uses a method called linear regression to learn from the training data. After learning, it tries to predict salaries for the test data. The accuracy of these predictions is checked using a calculation called mean squared error. Finally, it shows a graph where you can see how well the predictions match the actual salaries for both the training and testing data.
