The first program takes an input string, removes at least 2 characters from it, 
and then reverses the remaining characters before displaying the result. 
The second program replaces occurrences of the word 'python' with 'pythons' in a user-provided sentence. 
Lastly, the third program calculates a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F) based on a class score input using a
